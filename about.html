  <p>
    My name is Henry Lee, a senior software engineer. I love programming, especially in Ruby/Rails.
    I believe hard work will reward me more than trying to find short cuts.</br>
    In 2010, I graduated from Nantong University, with a bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology.
    I have been involved in every aspect of Rails development, building everything from front-end Javascript libraries to back-end application architectures. I also have experience on jQuery, MySQL, Redis, etc.
