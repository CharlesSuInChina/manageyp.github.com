  <h3>Brief Introduction</h3>
  <p>
      My name is Henry Lee, a senior Ruby developer. I love programming, especially in Ruby/Rails.
      </br>

      In 2010, I graduated from Nantong University, with a bachelor degree of Computer Science and Technology.</br></br>

      I have been involved in every aspect of Rails development, building everything from front-end Javascript libraries to back-end application architectures.
      I also have experience on jQuery, MySQL, Redis, etc.</br></br>

      I learned a lot skills from reading books. Let me introduce two of them: one is called Refactoring Ruby, and another one is Design patterns in ruby.</br>

      Refactoring Ruby shares a lots of tricks on refactoring code.
      It helps me to clean up my code.
      After refactoring, the code is easy to test and less bugs.</br>

      Design Patterns introduced some best practice in software designing.
      It presents effective techniques to simplify complex code.
      I realized a well-designed systems, is easier to maintain in the future.</br></br>

      Both of them improved my use of Ruby, as well as Rails
      and encouraged me to become an agile programmer.
      I believe hard work will reward me more than trying to find short cuts.
